I will configure Supabase Storage and ensure uploaded files **keep their original filenames** for easy searching.

**Plan:**

1.  **Install S3 Driver**: Install `league/flysystem-aws-s3-v3` for Supabase compatibility.
2.  **Configure Filesystem**: Add the `supabase` disk to `config/filesystems.php`.
3.  **Update Form**:
    *   Set storage disk to `supabase`.
    *   **Enable `preserveFilenames()`**: This ensures files are saved with their original names (e.g., `PO-123.pdf`) instead of random IDs.
    *   Add the **PDF Viewer** component.
    *   Keep Scanner disabled.
4.  **Create Viewer**: Implement the viewer to display the files from Supabase.

**Note on Env Vars:**
I will set up the configuration to look for `SUPABASE_STORAGE_*` keys in your `.env` file, which you will need to provide.
