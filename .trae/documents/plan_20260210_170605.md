I will implement an **Advanced OCR Auto-Fill** feature that attempts to extract both header details and **Line Items** (Material, Qty, Price, etc.) from the Purchase Order.

### Mechanism
1.  **Image Processing**: The browser will pre-process the image (contrast/grayscale) to improve readability.
2.  **Text Recognition**: `Tesseract.js` will extract the text line-by-line.
3.  **Intelligent Parsing**:
    -   **Header**: Search for keywords like "PO No", "Date".
    -   **Table Detection**: The script will look for table headers (e.g., "Description", "Qty", "Amount") and attempt to parse the rows below them into the **Line Items** list.
    -   **Data Mapping**: Extracted items will be automatically added to the "Line Items" section of your form.

### Implementation Steps
1.  **Create Scanner Component**:
    -   File: `resources/views/filament/components/purchase-order-scanner.blade.php`.
    -   Features: Drag & Drop zone, Progress bar, and Canvas for image processing.
2.  **Develop Parsing Logic (JavaScript)**:
    -   Implement a smart parser to identify column structures for: `Material`, `Description`, `Qty`, `UoM`, `Price`, and `Total`.
    -   *Note*: This works best with standard clean layouts.
3.  **Integrate with Form**:
    -   Add the component to `PurchaseOrderForm`.
    -   Connect the JS output to Filament's `items` repeater field to auto-populate the table rows.
