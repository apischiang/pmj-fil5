I will fix the `FileNotPreviewableException` by configuring Livewire to allow PDF previews.

**Reason for Error:**
Livewire (the underlying framework) restricts which temporary files can be previewed/accessed via a URL for security reasons. By default, it allows images but blocks PDFs. To view a temporary PDF file (before it's permanently saved), we need to explicitly allow it in the configuration.

**Plan:**
1.  **Publish Livewire Configuration**: Run `php artisan livewire:publish --config` to generate the `config/livewire.php` file.
2.  **Allow PDF Previews**: Edit `config/livewire.php` to add `pdf` and `application/pdf` to the `temporary_file_upload.preview_mimes` list.

This will allow the `PurchaseOrderForm` to display the PDF immediately after you drag & drop it, even before you click "Save".
