I will modify the document viewer to display the PDF/Image in a **popup modal** instead of embedding it directly in the form.

**Plan:**
1.  **Update Viewer Component**: I will rewrite `resources/views/filament/components/purchase-order-viewer.blade.php`.
    *   Replace the inline `<iframe>` with a **"View Document" button**.
    *   Add a **Modal (Popup)** using Alpine.js that opens when the button is clicked.
    *   The modal will contain the PDF viewer or Image, centered on the screen with a backdrop.
    *   Add a "Close" button to the modal.

This ensures the form remains clean, and the document is only shown when you explicitly want to see it.
