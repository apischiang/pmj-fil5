I will modify the layout to use the **Full Width (3/3)** of the screen, removing the sidebar and organizing the content vertically. This is often better for forms with many columns in the "Items" section.

### **Proposed Layout: Full Width Stacked**

1.  **Top Section (Header):**
    -   Combine **Customer** selection and **Document Details** (Quotation #, Status, Dates) into a single full-width section.
    -   Use a 4-column grid: Customer (2 cols) | Quotation # (1 col) | Status (1 col).
    -   Dates (Issue & Expiry) on a second row or integrated.

2.  **Middle Section (Items):**
    -   **Items Repeater** will span the full width (3/3).
    -   This gives maximum space for Item Name, Description, Quantity, Price, Discount, VAT, and Total to be displayed clearly without cramping.

3.  **Bottom Section (Footer):**
    -   **Left:** Notes & Terms.
    -   **Right:** Summary Totals (Subtotal, Tax, Grand Total).

This approach ensures the form uses 100% of the available screen real estate.
