I will fix the issues with the popup modal and the save button.

**Fixing "Why always save?":**
I will explicitly add `tag="button"` and `type="button"` to the `x-filament::button` component. By default, buttons inside a form are treated as submit buttons (triggering a save). Setting the type to "button" ensures it only runs the Javascript logic (opening the modal) and does not submit the form.

**Fixing "Where the modal?":**
I will wrap the modal content in a `<template x-teleport="body">` tag.
*   **Problem**: Currently, the modal is rendered *inside* the form layout. If any parent container has `overflow: hidden` or `z-index` constraints (which is common in Filament/Tailwind layouts), the modal might be clipped or hidden behind other elements.
*   **Solution**: `x-teleport="body"` moves the modal's HTML to the very end of the `<body>` tag when it opens. This ensures it floats above *everything* on the page, guaranteeing it is visible and correctly positioned.

I will also increase the `z-index` to `z-50` (or higher if needed) to ensure it sits on top of all other Filament UI elements.
